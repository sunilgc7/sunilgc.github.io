      <h2>Biography</h2>
     <p><strong>Sunil G. C.</strong> is a researcher, educator, and expert in the fields of precision agriculture, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. With a passion for applying innovative technologies to agriculture, Sunil has made significant contributions to both industry and academia, driving advancements in automated systems, smart farming technologies, and AI-based research. His interdisciplinary background bridges agricultural engineering, robotics, and data science, providing him with a unique perspective on solving complex agricultural challenges.</p>

    <p>In the industry, Sunil has worked extensively as a software engineer, most notably at <strong>Deerwalk Inc.</strong>, Kathmandu, Nepal, where he contributed to the development of big data technologies and scalable systems using Cascading, Hadoop, and Elasticsearch. He also worked on optimizing resource utilization in cloud environments, which led to cost savings and improved performance. In addition to his work on large-scale data processing, Sunil's expertise in embedded systems was further honed during his internship at <strong>AGCO – Appareo Systems</strong> in Fargo, ND, where he contributed to the development and testing of telemetry control systems for vehicles, ensuring the proper implementation of protocols such as CAN bus and J1939.</p>

    <p>As a researcher, Sunil's focus has been on applying AI and machine learning to precision agriculture. He is currently a <strong>Postdoctoral Research Fellow</strong> at USDA-ARS & North Dakota State University, where he leads projects focused on high-throughput phenotyping systems, hyperspectral image data collection, and advanced machine learning models for crop damage classification. His work includes developing software for Region of Interest (ROI) labeling and training algorithms for identifying frost damage in crops like Canola, Camelina, and Strawberry. Sunil is also deeply involved in mentoring graduate students and collaborating on cutting-edge research that combines robotics, AI, and agriculture to create more efficient farming practices.</p>

    <p>Throughout his academic career, Sunil has also been an active educator. He served as a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> at North Dakota State University for the course <em>PAG 115: Introduction to Precision Agriculture</em>, where he helped undergraduate students grasp the fundamentals of precision agriculture. He has delivered guest lectures for advanced courses such as <em>ABEN 682: Instrumentation & Measurements</em> and <em>PAG 315: Electronic Systems in Precision Agriculture</em>, providing students with hands-on knowledge of Arduino systems and sensor technologies. Additionally, Sunil taught a computer graphics course at <strong>Janakpur Engineering College</strong> in Nepal, further strengthening his commitment to education and mentorship.</p>

    <p>Sunil's research has been widely published and cited in leading academic journals. His most-cited papers include his studies on deep learning for weed and crop species classification in greenhouse conditions and his work on using AI technology to classify beef cuts. His contributions to advancing AI technologies for precision agriculture are further reflected in recent papers, such as his work on a weed-crop dataset for robotic weed control systems and his development of the "Herschel Vision" software for hyperspectral image processing in machine learning pipelines.</p>

    <p>With a strong foundation in both industry and academia, Sunil G. C. continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in precision agriculture, aiming to make a lasting impact on sustainable farming practices through the use of artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>
